# CANSLIM Calculator

### Â© @simy46, 2024

## Project Description
**CANSLIM Calculator** is a sophisticated web application designed to implement the investment principles from *"How to Make Money in Stocks Getting Started: A Guide to Putting CAN SLIM Concepts into Action"* by Matthew Galgani. The CANSLIM method is a renowned strategy for identifying potential high-growth stocks using a combination of fundamental and technical analysis.

The site is structured into several sections:
- **Home**: The landing page with an overview of the site's features.
- **Trending/Daily**: A section highlighting trending stocks and daily gainers.
- **Market News**: Up-to-date financial news and analysis.
- **Crypto Analysis**: Insights and analysis on cryptocurrency markets.
- **Stock Buying Checklist**: A comprehensive checklist to assist investors in evaluating stock purchase decisions.
- **About**: Information about the project and its creator.

The application leverages data from the unofficial [Yahoo Finance API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yahoo-finance2) to gather real-time financial data, which is then processed by a custom algorithm to evaluate stocks based on the CAN SLIM criteria.

### Project Structure
- **Front-End**: The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is deployed on Vercel.
- **Back-End**: The server-side component is developed using Express.js and is hosted on Heroku.
