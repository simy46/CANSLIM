                        The CAN SLIM strategy was developed by William J. O'Neil, the founder of Investor's Business Daily. It is a powerful method for identifying growth stocks using a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. Each letter in the acronym CAN SLIM stands for a key criterion:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>C</strong>: Current quarterly earnings per share (EPS) increase</li>
                        <li><strong>A</strong>: Annual earnings increases</li>
                        <li><strong>N</strong>: New products, management, or other new events</li>
                        <li><strong>S</strong>: Supply and demand (shares outstanding)</li>
                        <li><strong>L</strong>: Leader or laggard</li>

            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <div class="profile-picture">
                <p>
                    My name is @simy46, and I am the sole developer behind CANSLIM Calculator. As a computer science student with a passion for mathematics, I started this journey in the summer of 2022 after exploring the CAN SLIM strategy. The realization struck me that the buying checklist, based on clear indicators, could be algorithmically transformed into a powerful tool, and numbers is what I undestand.
                </p>
                <img id="ip" src="./assets/img/ip.jpg" alt="xtern_ip logo">
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Although I am not a professional in finance, my passion for mathematics and understanding of numbers inspired me to start this project. Initially, I didn't know how to code a website, but I was determined to learn. Over the past two years, I have taught myself web development and successfully built both the frontend and backend of this platform from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
                This journey has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. I hope that CANSLIM Calculator helps you in your investment journey as much as it has helped me in my learning journey.
