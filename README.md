                                           -- Project Description --
CANSLIM Calculator is a website featuring an algorithm developed to apply the investment principles outlined
in "How to Make Money in Stocks Getting Started: A Guide to Putting CAN SLIM Concepts into Action" by Matthew Galgani.

The site is structured into several sections: Home, Trending/Daily, Market News, Crypto Analysis, Stock Buying Checklist,
and an About page. Utilizing data from the unofficial Yahoo Finance API, the algorithm processes this information to evaluate
the  investment potential of stocks based on specific criteria derived from the CAN SLIM method.
