        <h2 class="investment-title">Understanding Insider Trading Regulations</h2>
        <section class="investment-section">
            <h3 class="investment-subtitle">What Is Insider Trading?</h3>
            <p class="investment-text">
                Insider trading refers to the act of buying or selling a company's stock based on material, non-public information. This practice is considered illegal because it creates an uneven playing field, where insiders with privileged information can profit at the expense of regular investors. The fairness and integrity of financial markets depend on equal access to information, which is why insider trading is strictly prohibited.
            </p>
            <p class="investment-text">
                Regulatory bodies across different regions enforce strict laws to prevent insider trading, ensuring that all investors are treated fairly. These laws are crucial for maintaining transparency, boosting investor confidence, and preserving the integrity of the markets.
            </p>
            <ul class="investment-list">
                <li><strong>United States:</strong> The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rigorously enforces insider trading laws, imposing severe civil and criminal penalties to deter violations and uphold market integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>European Union:</strong> The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) governs insider trading across the EU, implementing strict measures to protect investors and enhance market transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Provincial regulators, such as the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the AutoritÃ© des marchÃ©s financiers (AMF), enforce insider trading laws to ensure a fair and transparent market environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="investment-text">
                These regulations are designed to foster a fair market environment where no one has an unfair advantage. By enforcing these laws, regulatory bodies help maintain investor confidence and ensure that markets operate with integrity.

                <h3 class="investment-subtitle">How the Stock Market Works</h3>
                <p class="investment-text">
                    Understanding how the stock market functions is fundamental for any investor. The stock market is a complex system where shares of publicly-held companies are issued, bought, and sold. It plays a critical role in the economy by providing companies with access to capital in exchange for giving investors a slice of ownership.
                </p>
                <p class="investment-text">
                    Here's a short video that explains the basics of how the stock market works, in a fun and engaging way:

            <h3 class="investment-subtitle">How Sentiment Drives the Market</h3>
            <p class="investment-text">
                Market sentiment reflects the collective emotions and attitudes of investors toward a particular market or asset. It plays a crucial role in driving market trends, as positive sentiment can lead to bullish markets, while negative sentiment can result in bearish conditions.

        <h2 class="investment-title">The Role of Economic Indicators</h2>
        <section class="investment-section">
            <h3 class="investment-subtitle">Key Indicators to Watch</h3>
            <p class="investment-text">
                Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation, provide critical insights into the health of the economy. Investors rely on these indicators to predict market movements and make informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p class="investment-text">
                For instance, higher-than-expected GDP growth signals economic strength, boosting investor confidence and driving up stock prices. Conversely, rising inflation can lead to higher interest rates, reducing consumer spending and impacting corporate profits.
            </p>
            <p class="investment-text">
                Keeping track of these indicators helps investors adjust their strategies to align with the current economic landscape.
